# Lottery_crawl
Auto applying for the lottery at BROADWAY DIRECT.

## This branch is for deploying Lambda functions with docker images.

### The repository has the following requirements:

Please check the dockerfile directly.

 ~~- `undetected_chromedriver`~~
 ~~- `selenium`~~
 ~~- `Chrome&Chrome driver`~~

### The environment I was using:

~~- `Python 3.7.8`~~
~~- `undetected_chromedriver 3.4.7`~~
~~- `selenium 4.9.1`~~


### Before running this program in Python, 
~~1. Create an account at https://broadwaydirect.com/~~

2. Create an accounts.txt and fill it out with the applicant's information. (refer to the 'accounts.txt' file under the 'sample' directory.)
3. Add another applicant's information to accounts.txt if you have more than one applicant.
4. Edited the **lottery_website.txt** if needed.



### Warning
The ReCaptcha detected feature was only tested when applying the Lion King.(The checkbox can be confirmed automatically)\
However, if the 3x3  image identification came out, you would have to handle it manually.
I was working on skipping applying the Lottery of the Lion King when the 3x3  image identification came out.
